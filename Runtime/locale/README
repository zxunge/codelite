Installing new locale:
- Create your codelite.mo file (using codelite.pot)
- Create a directory for your translation 
- Copy the codelite.mo to that directory

Example:
 To add an Italian translation file, create the directory 'it' and copy the file codelite.mo to it.
 So you should have this directory form:
 it/codelite.mo
